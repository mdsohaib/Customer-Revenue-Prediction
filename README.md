<h3>2. We build a web app on Django to mount the prediction model. 
<h3>3. We deploy the Django project on Heroku through github.

<h2>Deep Learning Model

<h3> So we start off with building a Deep learning model, a Sequential model with 3 hidden layers and train that model using the customer meta data datapoints </h3>
  <br> 
  
  <h2>Deploying on Heroku

<h3> This is the last part of the course where we will deploy the Django application on Heroku using the connections to github. </h3>
